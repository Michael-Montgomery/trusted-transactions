            <h2>About Joanna Branquinho</h2><br>
            <p>Little Red Riding Hood skipped away. She followed the twisty path and jumped over the puddles until
                she came to a bramble bush. Oh no! A thorn spiked her scarlet cloak and held her tight.
                “Keep still, my dear,” boomed a deep voice. “I’ll soon set you free.” Sure enough, the thorn
                snapped, the cloak flapped and Little Red Riding Hood swung around.
                “Thank you,” she cried, but all she could see was a tall dark shape, standing in the shadows.
                “Where are you walking to, all alone?” it asked, in its deep, booming voice. Little Red Riding Hood
                thought she caught a glimpse of big eyes and sharp teeth.
                “To Grandma’s house,” answered Little Red Riding Hood nervously. “She lives at the other end of
                Long-Lost Wood, in the cottage with a green door.” At that moment an owl hooted and the dark shape
                was gone, melting into the trees. Little Red Riding Hood didn’t know she had just met the Big Bad
                Wolf, so she just wandered along happily, singing tunes to herself.</p>
